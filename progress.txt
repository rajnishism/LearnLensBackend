[Deployment Issues]

	1. Hosted the Backend on Render-> When Render calls the Youtube Api for transcript -> Youtube refuse to send the transcript saying Too many request from the server. Actually Youtbe blocks all the request from render.com

	2. Paid the GPT Model (5 $ )
	3.Built the frontend but not yet deployed.
